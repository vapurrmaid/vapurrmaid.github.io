My shameless website. Currently I'm using it as a base for some DJ mixes.

## Who is Vapurrmaid

Vapurrmaid is Gregory (Grey preferred) Barkans. They tend to keep away from most areas of the internet, but can be found at the following:

## What is Vapurrmaid

Vapurrmaid is the name that Grey adopted as an internet alias and DJ name. But also we're all each other and one, so Vapurrmaid is everything contextual to existence from Grey's perspective.

## When is Vapurrmaid

Vapurrmaid was born in '91, but didn't surface until ~2015.

## Where is Vapurrmaid

Mostly Hamilton and Guelph, Ontario.

## Why is Vapurrmaid

Vapurrmaid is a form of expression that makes sense for Grey on the dysmal space that is the interwebs.

## Vapurrmaid as DJ

Vapurrmaid consumes a very wide variety of music. However, they primarly spin the following genres:

- e.b.m
- industrial
- industrial techno
- noise
- techno

### Select Mixes

Because Vapurrmaid steers clear of most interwebs (such as MixCloud, SoundCloud and Spotify), they primarily keep their mixes as downloadable/streamable from Google Drive until they stop cheaping out and fully self-host.
